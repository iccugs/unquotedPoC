# unquotedPoC fork
This is Visual C# code that will create a service executable to spawn a netcat reverse shell. Code needs to be modified in SimpleService.Designer.cs file. Also there might need to be changes to the AssemblyInfo portion.

The installer portion turned out to be unnecessary.

The payload is in SimpleService.Designer.cs. This is propbably the "wrong" area, but it compiles and bypasses AV, so I don't really care :-D

Happy hacking!
